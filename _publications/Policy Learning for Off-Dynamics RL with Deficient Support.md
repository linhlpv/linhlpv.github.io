excerpt: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) can effectively learn complex policies. However, learning these policies often demands extensive trial-and-error interactions with the environment. In many real-world scenarios, this approach is not practical due to the high costs of data collection and safety concerns. As a result, a common strategy is to transfer a policy trained in a low-cost, rapid source simulator to a real-world target environment. However, this process poses challenges. Simulators, no matter how advanced, cannot perfectly replicate the intricacies of the real world, leading to dynamics discrepancies between the source and target environments. Past research posited that the source domain must encompass all possible target transitions, a condition we term full support. However, expecting full support is often unrealistic, especially in scenarios where significant dynamics discrepancies arise. In this paper, our emphasis shifts to addressing large dynamics mismatch adaptation. We move away from the stringent full support condition of earlier research, focusing instead on crafting an effective policy for the target domain. Our proposed approach is simple but effective. It is anchored in the central concepts of the skewing and extension of source support towards target support to mitigate support deficiencies. Through comprehensive testing on a varied set of benchmarks, our method`s efficacy stands out, showcasing notable improvements over previous techniques.'
